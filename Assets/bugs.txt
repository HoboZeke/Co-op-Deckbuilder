Home Base, game starts here, from here you can open the game to multiplayer
Battle start, start in zoomed out view then zoom in to initial card draw.

Bugs
-Leader upgrade event forced other players out when host clicked it. (Might have been related to the bug of being able to multiple select event rewards, to monitor)
-Guady armour doesn't work
-Can change event location target when moving to it.
-Probably change destination it to a vote system?
-Change look and position of the info text on discard and recruit.

-Eager Deathhound not syncing it's effect.
-state desync, from hunt and fight.
-Card moves weirdly in hand if you try to play it when you can't
	-Also when freshly drawn and then moved over.
-State desync seems to be tied to playing treasure cards.


*Remote still had the other players figurine on the final explore node from round 1.
-Elven enchanter not working
-Eager recruit not wiping if it is the last play of a round.

-(Maybe have another event for item upgrades?

*Sync board states, need to sync
